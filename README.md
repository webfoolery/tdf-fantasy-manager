# TDF Fantasy Team Manager
## A browser based tool for managing your team &amp; trying out different rider combinations. 
 
Click on a rider name on either table to add/remove them from your selection.  
Click a column heading on either table to sort by that column (sort order is saved).  
Your rider selection is stored in your web browser &amp; will reload next time you visit the page.  
You can configure 3 different teams.  
You can duplicate a team to another slot by clicking the copy <img src="images/icon-copy-2-50px.png" alt="Copy team slot" width="22"> icon. Any existing team in that slot will be overwritten.  
You can mark/unmark riders as having withdrawn from the race by clicking the <img src="images/icon-remove-1-50px.png" alt="Copy team slot" width="22"> icon.  
Riders who have abandoned are in red with a line through their name <span style="color:red;">~~like this~~</span>. 

You can save any team here &amp; break all the rules, but below are the guidelines for the Fantasy TDF game. If these rules are broken it will show in the summary boxes underneath your team selection:</p>

- Max spend is 120 credits
